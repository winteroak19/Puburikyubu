# Puburikyubu
Puburikyubu is the less-stable, public version of Kyubu, a video-sharing website in development.
Anyone is free to use it, as long as they read the license and credit me.
# How to make a search bar easily
Unlike Kyubu, Puburikyubu doesn't have an already made search bar. Now, you may be asking,
"Why?"
and that is because it is based off of Google's Programmable Search Engine, so you will need to create that.
Things required:
- A domain, you can use a subdomain, a free domain, or a paid one
- Access to Google's Programamble Search Engine
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- First, go to https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/cse/create/new
- Type the domain you are using.
- Type the name of your website.
- Click 'Create'
- Finally, enjoy!
